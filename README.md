# workday-scheduler

## Directions
Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the Moment.js library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## Getting Started
 1. Created the HTML, JS, and CSS file.
 2. Linked the CSS and JS file to the HTML file.
 3. Created the divs that I needed to define when styling in my CSS. Also, so I can isolate them for when I need to add function styling from the JS file.
 4. Made styling in the CSS so that the content like the days and time can be displayed asthetically on the page.
 5. Made JS fuctions and to make the calendar interactive.
